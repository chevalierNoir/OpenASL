## Change Log
**2025-07-22**: Video downloading has been migrated from `youtube-dl` to `yt-dlp` due to issues observed with `youtube-dl`. After switching, the downloading script should now work as expected.

## Instructions
### 1. Download videos
Run the following command to download videos into `/path/to/raw-video`.
```
python prep/download.py --tsv data/openasl-v1.0.tsv --dest /path/to/raw-video
```

If you are on slurm, you can parallelize the video downloading with the following command:

``` 
python prep/download.py --tsv data/openasl-v1.0.tsv --dest /path/to/raw-video --nshard ${nshard} --slurm
```

where `${nshard}` is the number of jobs to launch. The slurm arguments can be modified via `--slurm-argument '{"slurm_array_parallelism":100,"slurm_partition":"cpu","timeout_min":240,"slurm_mem":"16g"}'`. 
> **Note:** Some videos may no longer be publicly available. 



### 2. Video preprocessing
The following command will trim the raw video into clips and spatially crop the video clips.


```
python prep/crop_video.py --tsv data/openasl-v1.0.tsv --bbox data/bbox-v1.0.json --raw /path/to/raw-video --output /path/to/video-clip --ffmpeg /path/to/ffmpeg
```

The processed video will be saved into `/path/to/video-clip`. `data/bbox-v1.0.json` contains the person bounding box of each video clip in the format of `[x0,y0,x1,y1]` normalized by the image width and height. Note the bounding boxes are generated based on face detection plus some heuristic processing and are not proofread by humans. Roughly the error rate is below `1%`.

Similar to step 1, you can parallelize this step on slurm.

```
python prep/crop_video.py --tsv data/openasl-v1.0.tsv --bbox data/bbox-v1.0.json --raw /path/to/raw-video --output /path/to/video-clip --ffmpeg /path/to/ffmpeg --slurm --nshard ${nshard}
```
